      <h1>Superlative Voter </h1>
      <p>
        The superlative voter allows users to create forms of superlatives, or
        paper plate awards. Then, they can share the group name to allow others
        to to vote on who they think should get each award.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try it out by creating an account and creating a form. Then, send
        everyone you want to vote with the group name you chose to the site to
        vote! You can monitor voting by using the "View a form" functionality.
      </p>
    </div>
